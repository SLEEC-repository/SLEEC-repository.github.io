    <section id="description"><p>With a rapidly ageing population, the world is facing a social care crisis (Appleby, 2009). Without a step change in the provision of social care, especially to the elderly, the increase in the budgets and resources allocated to social care will soon become unsustainable. Ambient assisted living (Blackman et al., 2016) (i.e., assisted living support provided in a person’s daily environment, with the aid of robotic and autonomous systems – RAS, Artificial Intelligence – AI, and other technologies) is widely envisaged as a key component of such a step change (Lee et al., 2018).<br />Given this vision, the development of assisted-living RAS and AI solutions has been the focus of intense research and industrial effort in recent years. Designed to help or even replace carers at home and in care homes, these solutions aim to support people with motor or cognitive impairments in a wide range of tasks, increasing their ability to pursue daily living activities independently. These advances have provided RAS solutions capable of assisting elderly and disabled users both in a monitoring/advisory role and with physical tasks. However, integrating the two types of assistance into a combined assistive-care RAS solution that can be used safely over a long period of time still poses significant challenges (SPARK, 2015). In the ALMI project, we employ a TIAGo robot that uses both its speech interaction and its object manipulation capabilities to help a user with mild motor and cognitive impairments in the daily activity of preparing a meal. Specifically, the TIAGo robot (i) provides step-by-step voice instructions guiding the user through the meal preparation task; (ii) fetches and hands to the user some of the food ingredients, kitchen utensils, crockery, etc. required for these steps; (iii) reminds the user (if needed) where to find other items that are required for the task, and that the robot cannot reach or handle.</p></section>
