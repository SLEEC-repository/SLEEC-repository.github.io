	<h1>RE 2025 Tutorial, Valencia</h1>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Tutors:</strong> Lina Marsso*, Marsha Chechik**, Nick Feng**, Sinem Getir Yaman***, Isobel Standen***, Pedro Ribeiro***, Ana Cavalcanti***, Radu Calinescu*** and Beverley Townsend****</p>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Institutions:</strong> *Department of Computer Science, Polytechnique Montréal, Canada and **Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada and ***Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK and ****Law School, University of York, UK</p>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 hours</p>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Abstract:</strong> A new class of requirements is of growing importance for many AI and autonomous systems. In applications ranging from assistive care to emergency management, software for autonomous systems (often using AI components) need to make decisions that are expected to comply with requirements that reflect the social, legal, ethical, empathetic and cultural (SLEEC) norms of its users. For example, the control software of an assistive-care robot should consider its users’ well-being and autonomy needs. In this tutorial, we will present a tool-supported methodology for the elicitation, formalisation, well-formedness validation, and compliance verification of SLEEC requirements, and show its application to an assistive-care robot.</p>

	<h1>ICSE 2025 Tutorial, Ottawa</h1>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Tutors:</strong> Lina Marsso*, Marsha Chechik**, Sinem Getir Yaman***, Pedro Ribeiro***, Isobel Standen***, Radu Calinescu*** and Beverly Townsend****</p>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Institutions:</strong> *Department of Computer Science, Polytechnique Montréal, Canada and **Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada and ***Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK and ****Law School, University of York, UK</p>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 hours</p>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This is the first ICSE tutorial that addresses specification, debugging, and compliance with social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) requirements for AI and autonomous systems. As the interaction between these systems and humans continues to grow, the importance of embedding these considerations into the design and development process increases. Attendees will be introduced to state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary methodologies relevant to practitioners. The tutorial presents the challenges posed by SLEEC requirements, and highlights the necessity of engaging the software engineering community in tackling these issues. Lastly, the tutorial brings together for the first time our recent research on the elicitation, specification, validation and verification of SLEEC requirements for AI and autononous systems, which was <a href="https://shorturl.at/c76Tl">shortlisted for a Best Paper Award at ETAPS 2023</a>, and <a href="https://shorturl.at/jmD0h">received a Distiguished Paper Award at ICSE 2024</a>.</p>

	<h1>ASE 2023 Tutorial, Luxembourg</h1>
	<img class="tutorials-image" src="/assets/images/tutorials/ase-tutorial-sleec.png" />
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Tutors:</strong> Sinem Getir Yaman*, Ana Cavalcanti*, Radu Calinescu* and Beverly Townsend**</p>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Institutions:</strong> *Department of Computer Science and **Law School, University of York, UK</p>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 hours</p>
	<p class="tutorials-description"><strong>Abstract:</strong> A new class of requirements is of growing importance for many software systems. In applications ranging from assistive care to emergency management, software systems perform operations and make decisions that must comply with the social, legal, ethical, empathetic and cultural (SLEEC) norms of their users. For example, the control software of an assistive-care robot must consider its users' well-being, privacy and autonomy needs. As another example, a software personal assistant must exhibit cultural sensitivity when addressing its users, and must seek user consent prior to sharing certain types of personal information. In this tutorial, we will present a tool-supported methodology for the elicitation, formalisation, consistency validation, and verification of these SLEEC requirements, using interactive exercises to demonstrate its application to software systems from domains such as assistive care and emergency management.</p>
