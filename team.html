		<p class="complex-list-elem-info-description">Dr. Sinem Getir Yaman is a postdoctoral researcher in the University of York’s Department of Computer Science. Her research focuses on methods for the modeling and verification of non-functional requirements, including SLEEC requirements, for software quality evaluation under uncertainty. Her background is in formal methods, and she is the lead developer of the SLEECVAL toolkit. She has experience of presenting the technical components of the methodology to software engineering audiences, e.g., through talks at conferences such as ETAPS~2023, giving tutorial at ASE~2023 and at large research programme meetings.</p>
