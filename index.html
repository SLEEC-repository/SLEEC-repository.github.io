        With a rapidly ageing population, the world is facing a social care crisis (Appleby, 2009). Without a step
        change in the provision of social care, especially to the elderly, the increase in the budgets and
        resources allocated to social care will soon become unsustainable. Ambient assisted living (Blackman
        et al., 2016) (i.e., assisted living support provided in a person’s daily environment,
        with the aid of robotic and autonomous systems – RAS, Artificial Intelligence – AI, and other
        technologies) is widely envisaged as a key component of such a step change (Lee et al., 2018).<br />Given this
        vision, the development of assisted-living RAS and AI solutions has been the focus of
        intense research and industrial effort in recent years. Designed to help or even replace carers at
        home and in care homes, these solutions aim to support people with motor or cognitive impairments in
        a wide range of tasks, increasing their ability to pursue daily living
        activities independently. These advances have provided RAS solutions capable of assisting
        elderly and disabled users both in a monitoring/advisory role and with physical tasks. However,
        integrating the two types of assistance into a combined assistive-care RAS solution that can be
        used safely over a long period of time still poses significant challenges (SPARK,
        2015).<br />In the ALMI project, we employ a TIAGo robot that uses both its speech interaction and
        its object manipulation capabilities to help a user with mild motor and cognitive impairments in the
        daily activity of preparing a meal. Specifically, the TIAGo robot (i) provides step-by-step voice
        instructions guiding the user through the meal preparation task; (ii) fetches and hands to the user
        some of the food ingredients, kitchen utensils, crockery, etc. required for these steps;
        (iii) reminds the user (if needed) where to find other items that are required for the task, and that
        the robot cannot reach or handle. Providing such support requires the robot to dynamically create,
        update and exploit a “knowledge store” of household item locations (over a long period of time); to
        track the user’s progress with the meal preparation task, so that instructions are
        delivered progressively and repeated if necessary; to handle disruptions safely, etc.
